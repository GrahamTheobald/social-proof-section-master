# Frontend Mentor - Social proof section solution

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

## My process

I started with the general layout of the html without worrying about the styling to get a basic layout of the page.
I used a red border and a green translucent background on every element to help aid this process. Otherwise it is
impossible to ascertain how your divs are being layed out.

After completing the layout I worked on the aesthetic styles

### What I learned

I learned that contemplating the page structure at the start helps you maintain understanding of what you are
trying to accomplish.

Also the benefits of a mobile first approach. They are much simpler lay-outs. My styles were far too complex to eradicate
by the time I had implemented them so I decided against implementing a mobile view.
